# 🚢 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs **data inspection, visualization, and basic feature engineering suggestions** to prepare the Titanic dataset for machine learning tasks such as survival prediction.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand the dataset using descriptive statistics.  
- Visualize relationships between features and survival outcomes.  
- Detect patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data.  
- Provide feature-level insights for predictive modeling.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly (optional for interactive plots)  

---

## 📂 Dataset
You can use:  
- **Kaggle’s Titanic dataset** (CSV format)  
- Or **Seaborn’s built-in Titanic dataset** (used automatically if no path is provided)  

---

## 📊 Features of the Script
- Load Titanic dataset: From local CSV or Seaborn’s dataset.  
- Automatic standardization of column names.  
- **Summary statistics**: Numeric features (`describe`) and categorical features.  
- **Missing-value detection** with heatmap visualization.  
- **Distribution plots**: Histograms, KDE plots (e.g., Age, Fare).  
- **Outlier detection** with boxplots.  
- **Correlation analysis**:  
  - Correlation matrix  
  - Heatmap with annotations  
- **Pairplot**: Numeric features vs. survival outcomes.  
- **Categorical survival analysis**:  
  - Survival rate by sex  
  - Survival rate by passenger class  
- **Pivot heatmap**: Survival by passenger class × sex.  
- **Missing-value handling suggestions**.  
- **Feature engineering ideas** for modeling.  
- **Final observations**: Insights on survival by sex and class.
